# Zelle-Chatbot
This repository contains the source code to create a Zelle chatbot, which can
answer basic FAQs (inspired from the ones found here: https://www.zellepay.com/faq/about-zelle)
as well as contact customer support. The steps for this task consisted of
creating an intents file (of intents, patterns, responses, and context),
data preparation (processing the intents file to be used for training),
building the deep learning model, and creating a GUI.
